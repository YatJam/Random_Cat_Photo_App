# SWIFT Project - Random Cat Generator

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [How to Run](#howtorun)


## Introduction

This is an experimental project using the Swift programming langauge and is a means to try out new ideas and hone skills for mobile app development.

The initial build is using a simple Swift introductory tutorial and applied my own twist by using a random cat image api that also allowed custom text to be applied to each image.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
Please ensure you have Xcode IDE installed on your machine to run the simulator build.

### Executing the code
1. Clone the repo: from your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/YatJam/Random_Cat_Photo_App.git`
1. Using Xcode, select "open a project or file" and select the cloned folder.
1. You should now be presented with the file structure of the app.
1. To build the app in the simulator, select the "play" (Start the Active Scheme) button in the top left.
1. The simulator may take a few moments to initialise. 
    - Once initialised, you should be able to click on the random generator button for all your random cat picture needs.

### Terminate the applications
1. Stop the application in Xcode but selecting the stop (Stop the Active Scheme) button on the top left.
